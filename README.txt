# WhaterPiplineSystem

I dicided to represent the water pipeline system by 2 graphs. Theese graphs was colled part1 and part2 (exsemplars of Graph class).
Also I created class Node<> which keeps information about previous and next point and about the distance between tham. 
Unfortunatly, there were not enough time for me to add reading from CSV file, method which would check existing the edges between nodes and calcilates the route.(
